# Site of Theseus

The **Site of Theseus** is an experimental and evolving web platform powered by autonomous agents. Inspired by the philosophical paradox of identity and change, this project continuously redefines its own structure and content, creating a self-updating, ever-changing digital presence.

## Core Features

The project leverages AI-driven automation to ensure the site evolves dynamically over time. Below is a breakdown of the core functionality (excluding the procedurally generated `website` folder):

### üöÄ `auto_dev.py`
- Acts as the central engine for the site's evolution.
- Utilizes AI agents to analyze, modify, and enhance the website's content and structure in real-time.
- Ensures continuous iteration with minimal human intervention.

### ‚öôÔ∏è `config.yaml`
- The project's configuration hub.
- Houses all key parameters and settings that dictate the behavior of the AI agents and the content generation pipeline.
- Easily customizable to guide the site‚Äôs growth in new directions.

### üîÑ `reset.py`
- Provides a robust mechanism to archive the current state of the website and reset it to a baseline.
- Enables the system to initiate fresh iterations while preserving the essence of past versions.

## Philosophy

This project challenges the notion of digital permanence by embracing change as a core principle. Like the Ship of Theseus, the site undergoes constant transformation, questioning whether its identity remains intact as its parts are replaced.

## Technical Highlights
- **AI-Driven Automation:** Fully autonomous system that requires minimal oversight.
- **Self-Sustaining:** Continuous evolution without manual updates.
- **Reset and Archive System:** Allows for controlled experimentation and fresh starts.

## Future Directions
- Enhanced AI agents for more sophisticated content creation.
- Integration with external APIs to incorporate real-time data.
- Improved UX for tracking the site's transformation history.
